Description: GAuthx enables the use of the Google Authenticator mobile app for 2-factor-authentication in conjunction with Shaun McCormick's Login Snippet (https://github.com/splittingred/Login) and contains two snippets, one to generate authentication secrets and displaying a QR-Code. The other is used as a Login PreHook to validate tokens generated by the Google Authenticator app when a user attempts to login.
